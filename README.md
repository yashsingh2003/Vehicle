# 🚗 Vehicle Dataset Analysis

This project presents a detailed analysis of a vehicle dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It explores trends and insights related to vehicle types, fuel efficiency, engine attributes, and more through data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains various details about vehicles, which may include the following attributes:

- `Make` – Brand of the vehicle
- `Model` – Specific model name
- `Year` – Year of manufacture
- `Engine Fuel Type` – Type of fuel used (e.g., petrol, diesel, hybrid)
- `Engine HP` – Horsepower
- `Engine Cylinders` – Number of cylinders
- `Transmission Type` – Automatic or manual
- `Driven_Wheels` – Type of drivetrain (FWD, RWD, AWD)
- `Number of Doors` – Count of vehicle doors
- `Vehicle Size` – Compact, midsize, large
- `Vehicle Style` – SUV, Sedan, Hatchback, etc.
- `highway MPG`, `city MPG`, `MSRP` – Fuel efficiency and price



## ⚙️ Requirements

To run the notebook, make sure the following Python libraries are installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn

## 🚀 How to Run the Notebook

->Download or clone this repository.
->Launch Jupyter Notebook in your terminal:
->Open Vehicles.ipynb.
->Run all cells to see the full analysis.

## 🔍 Key Analysis Covered

The notebook includes:
->->Loading and cleaning vehicle data
->Handling missing values and duplicates
->Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
->Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
->Deriving insights from price, fuel efficiency, engine features, etc.

## 📈 Visualizations Included

->Distribution plots for vehicle MSRP, horsepower, and fuel economy
->Bar plots comparing fuel types and transmission types
->Heatmap for correlation analysis between numeric features
->Box plots for price comparison by vehicle type or size

## 💡 Insights & Findings

->Fuel type and transmission significantly influence vehicle prices.
->Horsepower and number of cylinders correlate with MSRP.
->SUVs and luxury vehicles tend to have higher MSRP values.
->Fuel efficiency differs substantially between vehicle styles.
